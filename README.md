# CRCP3320-1247-typescript-template
A TypeScript project template for CRCP 3320 in the Fall 2024 term. This code generates a random creature with random colors. This is the basis code and further iterations will refine the position as well as including an interactive element. Unlike the project propoal, we are not using png images via procreate but instead using p5 to draw each individual one. Each time you refresh the page is a new "cat". Maria's computer was first broken so we both worked on this code together in person, but now we can work on it from individual devices. We each contribute by adding new features and implementations to the cat generated.
